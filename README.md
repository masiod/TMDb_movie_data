# TMDb_movie_data

Project Title:
TMDb Movie Data
About Dataset
Background
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?

Installation:
[git clone https://github.com/masiod/TMDb_movie_data.git]

Usage :
we used this for training in data analysis its old but good way to imporve your skills in jupyter of VS Code jupyter
Inspiration
Can you categorize the films by type, such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this, but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles.

How sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on?
